I think I begin to know what the functional code is after reading your posts and code. But I have some questions about this:<br>For the GetHashCode(), why don't you try \"xor\" other than \"or\"? I think \"xor\" will get a better job than the \"or\"~<br>For something about all the code, and I found TypeUnion&lt;T&gt; is really useless!
