If NOTHING else, you will be able to write-off somewhere around $8000 (something like that) in interest in your first year.<br>Even if the house goes DOWN in value (which it may in the short term but will NEVER in the long term) - even if you broke even and wanted to sell the house, you at LEAST got the interest write-off.
